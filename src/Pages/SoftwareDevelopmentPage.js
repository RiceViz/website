                text="During Henhacks Spring 2023, U-GO was createdâ€”an innovation emerging from the one-day hackathon hosted by the University 
                of Delaware Computer Science Department and UD CPUs, a prominent student-led computer science club. The primary aim of U-GO is 
                to provide students with a more precise GPS experience while navigating the diverse halls and buildings on the university's campus.
                Unlike mainstream GPS applications such as Google Maps, U-GO offers specific routes that others may overlook. Additionally, our
                vision includes implementing a GPS system for the interior of every building, facilitating easy navigation to room numbers. The 
                project secured the coveted first place in its category, earning a prize pool of $1,600, triumphing over 30 other competing teams."
